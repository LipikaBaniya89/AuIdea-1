# Au Idea
A platform for students to see a list of available senior projects and recommend the projects based on student's academic records.

# Description
Senior projects are part of Assumption University of Thailand's Bachelor of Science degree. Students in the third and fourth years must spend the entire semester working on a single project, creating something that can be used in the real world by people. Students can work in groups of 1-3 people on these projects, which are guided by faculty instructors.

This application aims to offer freshmen with all of this essential information in order to assist them with their future projects. It includes a list of projects with useful information, a project report, information on the project adviser, and many more features. When students enroll in senior project 1 or 2, looking at previous projects can help them come up with their own ideas.

# Working
